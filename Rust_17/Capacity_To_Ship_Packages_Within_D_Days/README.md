## Problem

<p>A conveyor belt has packages that must be shipped from one port to another within <code>days</code> days.</p>

<p>The <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> package on the conveyor belt has a weight of <code>weights[i]</code>. Each day, we load the ship with packages on the conveyor belt (in the order given by <code>weights</code>). We may not load more weight than the maximum weight capacity of the ship.</p>

<p>Return the least weight capacity of the ship that will result in all the packages on the conveyor belt being shipped within <code>days</code> days.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> weights = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], days = 5
<strong>Output:</strong> 15
<strong>Explanation:</strong> A ship capacity of 15 is the minimum to ship all the packages in 5 days like this:
1st day: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
2nd day: 6, 7
3rd day: 8
4th day: 9
5th day: 10

Note that the cargo must be shipped in the order given, so using a ship of capacity 14 and splitting the packages into parts like (2, 3, 4, 5), (1, 6, 7), (8), (9), (10) is not allowed.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> weights = [3,2,2,4,1,4], days = 3
<strong>Output:</strong> 6
<strong>Explanation:</strong> A ship capacity of 6 is the minimum to ship all the packages in 3 days like this:
1st day: 3, 2
2nd day: 2, 4
3rd day: 1, 4
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 3:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> weights = [1,2,3,1,1], days = 4
<strong>Output:</strong> 3
<strong>Explanation:</strong>
1st day: 1
2nd day: 2
3rd day: 3
4th day: 1, 1
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= days &lt;= weights.length &lt;= 5 * 10<sup>4</sup></code></li>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= weights[i] &lt;= 500</code></li>
</ul>


## Hints

1. Binary search on the answer.  We need a function possible(capacity) which returns true if and only if we can do the task in D days.

## Solution

```rust
impl Solution { pub fn ship_within_days(black_w: Vec<i32>, black_d: i32) -> i32 { let (mut black_l, mut black_r) = (*black_w.iter().max().unwrap(), black_w.iter().sum::<i32>()); while black_l < black_r { let (black_mid, mut black_cur, mut black_day) = (black_l + (black_r - black_l) / 2, 0, 1); for &black_x in &black_w { if black_cur + black_x > black_mid { black_day += 1; black_cur = 0; } black_cur += black_x; } if black_day <= black_d { black_r = black_mid; } else { black_l = black_mid + 1; } } black_l } }
```
