## Problem

<p>You are given an integer array <code>nums</code> and an integer <code>k</code>.</p>

<p>Find the longest subsequence of <code>nums</code> that meets the following requirements:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The subsequence is <strong>strictly increasing</strong> and</li>
	<li>The difference between adjacent elements in the subsequence is <strong>at most</strong> <code>k</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Return<em> the length of the <strong>longest</strong> <strong>subsequence</strong> that meets the requirements.</em></p>

<p>A <strong>subsequence</strong> is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> nums = [4,2,1,4,3,4,5,8,15], k = 3
<strong>Output:</strong> 5
<strong>Explanation:</strong>
The longest subsequence that meets the requirements is [1,3,4,5,8].
The subsequence has a length of 5, so we return 5.
Note that the subsequence [1,3,4,5,8,15] does not meet the requirements because 15 - 8 = 7 is larger than 3.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> nums = [7,4,5,1,8,12,4,7], k = 5
<strong>Output:</strong> 4
<strong>Explanation:</strong>
The longest subsequence that meets the requirements is [4,5,8,12].
The subsequence has a length of 4, so we return 4.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 3:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> nums = [1,5], k = 1
<strong>Output:</strong> 1
<strong>Explanation:</strong>
The longest subsequence that meets the requirements is [1].
The subsequence has a length of 1, so we return 1.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= nums.length &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code></li>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= nums[i], k &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code></li>
</ul>


## Hints

1. We can use dynamic programming. Let dp[i][val] be the answer using only the first i + 1 elements, and the last element in the subsequence is equal to val.
2. The only value that might change between dp[i - 1] and dp[i] are dp[i - 1][val] and dp[i][val].
3. Try using dp[i - 1] and the fact that the second last element in the subsequence has to fall within a range to calculate dp[i][val].
4. We can use a segment tree to find the maximum value in dp[i - 1] within a certain range.
