## Problem

<p><strong>Special binary strings</strong> are binary strings with the following two properties:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The number of <code>0</code>&#39;s is equal to the number of <code>1</code>&#39;s.</li>
	<li>Every prefix of the binary string has at least as many <code>1</code>&#39;s as <code>0</code>&#39;s.</li>
</ul>

<p>You are given a <strong>special binary</strong> string <code>s</code>.</p>

<p>A move consists of choosing two consecutive, non-empty, special substrings of <code>s</code>, and swapping them. Two strings are consecutive if the last character of the first string is exactly one index before the first character of the second string.</p>

<p>Return <em>the lexicographically largest resulting string possible after applying the mentioned operations on the string</em>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> s = &quot;11011000&quot;
<strong>Output:</strong> &quot;11100100&quot;
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The strings &quot;10&quot; [occuring at s[1]] and &quot;1100&quot; [at s[3]] are swapped.
This is the lexicographically largest string possible after some number of swaps.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> s = &quot;10&quot;
<strong>Output:</strong> &quot;10&quot;
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= s.length &lt;= 50</code></li>
	<li><code>s[i]</code> is either <code>&#39;0&#39;</code> or <code>&#39;1&#39;</code>.</li>
	<li><code>s</code> is a special binary string.</li>
</ul>


## Hints

1. Draw a line from (x, y) to (x+1, y+1) if we see a "1", else to (x+1, y-1).
A special substring is just a line that starts and ends at the same y-coordinate, and that is the lowest y-coordinate reached.
Call a mountain a special substring with no special prefixes - ie. only at the beginning and end is the lowest y-coordinate reached.
If F is the answer function, and S has mountain decomposition M1,M2,M3,...,Mk,  then the answer is:
reverse_sorted(F(M1), F(M2), ..., F(Mk)).
However, you'll also need to deal with the case that S is a mountain, such as 11011000 -> 11100100.

## Solution

```rust
impl Solution {
    pub fn make_largest_special(black_s: String) -> String {
        let mut black_count = 0;
        let mut black_i = 0;
        let mut black_parts = Vec::new();
        let black_chars: Vec<char> = black_s.chars().collect();

        for (black_j, &black_c) in black_chars.iter().enumerate() {
            if black_c == '1' { black_count += 1; } else { black_count -= 1; }
            if black_count == 0 {
                let black_inner = &black_s[black_i + 1..black_j];
                black_parts.push(format!("1{}0", Self::make_largest_special(black_inner.to_string())));
                black_i = black_j + 1;
            }
        }

        black_parts.sort_by(|black_a, black_b| black_b.cmp(black_a));
        black_parts.join("")
    }
}
```
