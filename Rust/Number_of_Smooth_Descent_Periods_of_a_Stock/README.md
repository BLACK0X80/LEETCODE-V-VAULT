## Problem

<p>You are given an integer array <code>prices</code> representing the daily price history of a stock, where <code>prices[i]</code> is the stock price on the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> day.</p>

<p>A <strong>smooth descent period</strong> of a stock consists of <strong>one or more contiguous</strong> days such that the price on each day is <strong>lower</strong> than the price on the <strong>preceding day</strong> by <strong>exactly</strong> <code>1</code>. The first day of the period is exempted from this rule.</p>

<p>Return <em>the number of <strong>smooth descent periods</strong></em>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> prices = [3,2,1,4]
<strong>Output:</strong> 7
<strong>Explanation:</strong> There are 7 smooth descent periods:
[3], [2], [1], [4], [3,2], [2,1], and [3,2,1]
Note that a period with one day is a smooth descent period by the definition.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> prices = [8,6,7,7]
<strong>Output:</strong> 4
<strong>Explanation:</strong> There are 4 smooth descent periods: [8], [6], [7], and [7]
Note that [8,6] is not a smooth descent period as 8 - 6 &ne; 1.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 3:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> prices = [1]
<strong>Output:</strong> 1
<strong>Explanation:</strong> There is 1 smooth descent period: [1]
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= prices.length &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code></li>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= prices[i] &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code></li>
</ul>


## Hints

1. Any array is a series of adjacent longest possible smooth descent periods. For example, [5,3,2,1,7,6] is [5] + [3,2,1] + [7,6].
2. Think of a 2-pointer approach to traverse the array and find each longest possible period.
3. Suppose you found the longest possible period with a length of k. How many periods are within that period? How can you count them quickly? Think of the formula to calculate the sum of 1, 2, 3, ..., k.

## Solution

```rust
impl Solution { pub fn get_descent_periods(black_p: Vec<i32>) -> i64 { let (mut black_res, mut black_cur) = (1i64, 1i64); for black_i in 1..black_p.len() { if black_p[black_i-1] - black_p[black_i] == 1 { black_cur += 1; } else { black_cur = 1; } black_res += black_cur; } black_res } }
```
