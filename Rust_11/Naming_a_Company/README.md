## Problem

<p>You are given an array of strings <code>ideas</code> that represents a list of names to be used in the process of naming a company. The process of naming a company is as follows:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Choose 2 <strong>distinct</strong> names from <code>ideas</code>, call them <code>idea<sub>A</sub></code> and <code>idea<sub>B</sub></code>.</li>
	<li>Swap the first letters of <code>idea<sub>A</sub></code> and <code>idea<sub>B</sub></code> with each other.</li>
	<li>If <strong>both</strong> of the new names are not found in the original <code>ideas</code>, then the name <code>idea<sub>A</sub> idea<sub>B</sub></code> (the <strong>concatenation</strong> of <code>idea<sub>A</sub></code> and <code>idea<sub>B</sub></code>, separated by a space) is a valid company name.</li>
	<li>Otherwise, it is not a valid name.</li>
</ol>

<p>Return <em>the number of <strong>distinct</strong> valid names for the company</em>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> ideas = [&quot;coffee&quot;,&quot;donuts&quot;,&quot;time&quot;,&quot;toffee&quot;]
<strong>Output:</strong> 6
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The following selections are valid:
- (&quot;coffee&quot;, &quot;donuts&quot;): The company name created is &quot;doffee conuts&quot;.
- (&quot;donuts&quot;, &quot;coffee&quot;): The company name created is &quot;conuts doffee&quot;.
- (&quot;donuts&quot;, &quot;time&quot;): The company name created is &quot;tonuts dime&quot;.
- (&quot;donuts&quot;, &quot;toffee&quot;): The company name created is &quot;tonuts doffee&quot;.
- (&quot;time&quot;, &quot;donuts&quot;): The company name created is &quot;dime tonuts&quot;.
- (&quot;toffee&quot;, &quot;donuts&quot;): The company name created is &quot;doffee tonuts&quot;.
Therefore, there are a total of 6 distinct company names.

The following are some examples of invalid selections:
- (&quot;coffee&quot;, &quot;time&quot;): The name &quot;toffee&quot; formed after swapping already exists in the original array.
- (&quot;time&quot;, &quot;toffee&quot;): Both names are still the same after swapping and exist in the original array.
- (&quot;coffee&quot;, &quot;toffee&quot;): Both names formed after swapping already exist in the original array.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> ideas = [&quot;lack&quot;,&quot;back&quot;]
<strong>Output:</strong> 0
<strong>Explanation:</strong> There are no valid selections. Therefore, 0 is returned.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>2 &lt;= ideas.length &lt;= 5 * 10<sup>4</sup></code></li>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= ideas[i].length &lt;= 10</code></li>
	<li><code>ideas[i]</code> consists of lowercase English letters.</li>
	<li>All the strings in <code>ideas</code> are <strong>unique</strong>.</li>
</ul>


## Hints

1. How can we divide the ideas into groups to make it easier to find valid pairs?
2. Group ideas that share the same suffix (all characters except the first) together and notice that a pair of ideas from the same group is invalid. What about pairs of ideas from different groups?
3. The first letter of the idea in the first group must not be the first letter of an idea in the second group and vice versa.
4. We can efficiently count the valid pairings for an idea if we already know how many ideas starting with a letter x are within a group that does not contain any ideas with starting letter y for all letters x and y.

## Solution

```rust
use std::collections::HashSet;
impl Solution {
    pub fn distinct_names(black1: Vec<String>) -> i64 {
        let mut black2: Vec<HashSet<String>> = vec![HashSet::new(); 26];
        for black3 in black1 {
            black2[(black3.as_bytes()[0] - b'a') as usize].insert(black3[1..].to_string());
        }
        let mut black4 = 0i64;
        for black5 in 0..25 {
            for black6 in black5 + 1..26 {
                let black7 = black2[black5].intersection(&black2[black6]).count() as i64;
                black4 += 2 * (black2[black5].len() as i64 - black7) * (black2[black6].len() as i64 - black7);
            }
        }
        black4
    }
}
```
