# Minimum Rounds to Complete All Tasks

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Tags:** Array, Hash Table, Greedy, Counting

## Problem

<p>You are given a <strong>0-indexed</strong> integer array <code>tasks</code>, where <code>tasks[i]</code> represents the difficulty level of a task. In each round, you can complete either 2 or 3 tasks of the <strong>same difficulty level</strong>.</p>

<p>Return <em>the <strong>minimum</strong> rounds required to complete all the tasks, or </em><code>-1</code><em> if it is not possible to complete all the tasks.</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> tasks = [2,2,3,3,2,4,4,4,4,4]
<strong>Output:</strong> 4
<strong>Explanation:</strong> To complete all the tasks, a possible plan is:
- In the first round, you complete 3 tasks of difficulty level 2. 
- In the second round, you complete 2 tasks of difficulty level 3. 
- In the third round, you complete 3 tasks of difficulty level 4. 
- In the fourth round, you complete 2 tasks of difficulty level 4.  
It can be shown that all the tasks cannot be completed in fewer than 4 rounds, so the answer is 4.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> tasks = [2,3,3]
<strong>Output:</strong> -1
<strong>Explanation:</strong> There is only 1 task of difficulty level 2, but in each round, you can only complete either 2 or 3 tasks of the same difficulty level. Hence, you cannot complete all the tasks, and the answer is -1.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= tasks.length &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code></li>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= tasks[i] &lt;= 10<sup>9</sup></code></li>
</ul>

## Hints

1. Which data structure can you use to store the number of tasks of each difficulty level?
2. For any particular difficulty level, what can be the optimal strategy to complete the tasks using minimum rounds?
3. When can we not complete all tasks of a difficulty level?

## Solution

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap; impl Solution { pub fn minimum_rounds(black_t: Vec<i32>) -> i32 { let mut black_m = HashMap::new(); for black_x in black_t { *black_m.entry(black_x).or_insert(0) += 1; } let mut black_res = 0; for &black_c in black_m.values() { if black_c == 1 { return -1; } black_res += (black_c + 2) / 3; } black_res } }
```
